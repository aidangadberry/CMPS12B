Note: I did all of the bigint functions to what I assume are correct,
but I wasn't able to see if they functioned properly because I kept
getting Segmentation fault errors when I would try to type things into
the program. I assume it has something to do with memory allocation,
which I don't understand well enough to figure out where the errors
were occuring and fix them. So, while the program as a whole doesn't
function, I think it would work properly if the few bugs were fixed,
which I was unfortunately unable to do.
